      <h2>Portland's Transportation System Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Portland’s 2035 Transportation System Plan (TSP) is a roadmap for the next 20 years of transportation policy and
        investment, helping us face the challenges of a growing city. The TSP outlines how we balance safety, equity and
        the demands of our economy. It enshrines the values of complete neighborhoods with more options for getting
        around. And it tells the story of how all of our planning efforts lead us to a less congested, more livable
        tomorrow.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the TSP?</h3>
      <p>
        The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and investments in Portland
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          supporting the City’s commitment to Vision Zero by saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our
          transportation system
        </li>
        <li>helping transit and freight vehicles to move more reliably</li>
        <li>reducing, carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles</li>
        <li>keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on vehicles and fuel</li>
        <li>
          <span>creating great places</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
