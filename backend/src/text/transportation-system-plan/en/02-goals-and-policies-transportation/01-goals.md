## Transportation Goals

(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 9)

### Safety

The City achieves the standard of zero traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries. Transportation safety impacts the livability of a city and the comfort and security of those using City streets. Comprehensive efforts to improve transportation safety through equity, engineering, education, enforcement and evaluation will be used to eliminate traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries from Portland's transportation system. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.A)

### Multiple goals

Portland's transportation system is funded and maintained to achieve multiple goals and measurable outcomes for people and the environment. The transportation system is safe, complete, interconnected, multimodal, and fulfills daily needs for people and businesses. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.B)

### Great places

Portland's transportation system enhances quality of life for all Portlanders, reinforces existing neighborhoods and great places, and helps make new great places in town centers, neighborhood centers and corridors, and civic corridors. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.C)

### Environmentally sustainable

The transportation system increasingly uses active transportation, renewable energy, or electricity from renewable sources, achieves adopted carbon reduction targets, and reduces air pollution, water pollution, noise, and Portlanders' reliance on private vehicles. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.D)

### Equitable transportation

The transportation system provides all Portlanders options to move about the city and meet their daily needs by using a variety of safe, efficient, convenient, and affordable modes of transportation. Transportation investments are responsive to the distinct needs of each community. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.E)

### Positive health outcomes

The transportation system promotes positive health outcomes and minimizes negative impacts for all Portlanders by supporting active transportation, physical activity, and community and individual health. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.F)

### Opportunities for prosperity

The transportation system supports a strong and diverse economy, enhances the competitiveness of the city and region, and maintains Portland's role as a West Coast trade gateway and freight hub by providing efficient and reliable goods movement, multimodal access to employment areas and educational institutions, as well as enhanced freight access to industrial areas and intermodal freight facilities. The transportation system helps people and businesses reduce spending and keep money in the local economy by providing affordable alternatives to driving. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.G)

### Cost effectiveness

The City analyzes and prioritizes capital and operating investments to cost effectively achieve the above goals while responsibly managing and protecting our past investments in existing assets. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.H)
