### Major City Traffic Streets

Major City Traffic Streets are intended to serve as the principal routes for interdistrict traffic that has at least one trip end within a City of Portland transportation district.

> **Safety:** Safety should be the highest priority on Major City Traffic Streets. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Major City Traffic Streets to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes for all modes. Major City Traffic Streets should provide separation between motor vehicles and people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices, and provide safe multimodal crossings to destinations.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** Major City Traffic Streets should provide motor vehicle connections among the Central City, regional centers, town centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Auto-oriented development should locate adjacent to Major City Traffic Streets, except within designated centers, main streets, station areas, and other areas with high pedestrian demand.
>
> **Connections:** Major City Traffic Streets should serve as primary connections to Regional Trafficways and serve major activity centers in each district. Traffic with no trip ends within a City of Portland transportation district should be discouraged from using Major City Traffic Streets. Where a Major City Traffic Street intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.
>
> **On-Street Parking:** On-street parking may be removed and additional right-of-way purchased to provide adequate traffic access when consistent with the street design designation of the street. Evaluate the need for on-street parking to serve adjacent land uses and improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists when making changes to the roadway.
