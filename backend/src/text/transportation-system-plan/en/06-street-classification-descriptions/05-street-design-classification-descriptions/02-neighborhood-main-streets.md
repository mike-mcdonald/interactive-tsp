### Neighborhood Main Streets

Neighborhood Main Streets primarily serve surrounding neighborhoods and are designed to emphasize multimodal access to activity centers.

> **Land Use:** Neighborhood Main Streets are segments of Neighborhood Corridors located within the Central City, Regional Centers, Town Centers, Neighborhood Centers, and other areas of intensive commercial activity. Development consists of a mix of uses oriented to the street.
>
> **Lanes:** Neighborhood Main Streets typically include two vehicle lanes with additional turning lanes as needed,
>
> **Width:** Neighborhood Main Streets generally feature a narrower right-of-way than Civic Main Streets and may not be able to accommodate the full desired space for each mode.
>
> **Function:** Neighborhood Main Streets should emphasize pedestrian access to adjacent land uses while also accommodating access and mobility for other modes.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Neighborhood Main Streets should emphasize access and place-making functions (such as parking, loading, transit stops, street trees, curb extensions, and street seats) as needed to support adjacent land use and improve the pedestrian realm. The curb zone may be used for mobility functions if space is needed to provide bicycle facilities or provide turn lanes near intersections.
>
> **Separation:** Neighborhood Main Streets have frequent street connections and support multimodal access to destinations. Sidewalks should be provided and pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety and comfort. Bicycle facilities should generally be separated from motor vehicle traffic, though shared roadway facilities may be acceptable if traffic volumes and speeds are sufficiently low.
>
> **Design Elements:** Neighborhood Main Street design should typically include the following: wide sidewalks with a through pedestrian zone, a furnishing zone, and a frontage zone; closely-spaced pedestrian crossings; separated bicycle facilities; way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes; low vehicle speeds; medians and/or turn lanes as needed; and limited driveway access.
>
> **Design Treatment:** During improvement projects, the preservation of existing vegetation, topography, vistas and viewpoints, driver perception, street lighting, and sight distance requirements should be considered.
>
> **Utilities:** Consider undergrounding or reducing the visual impact of overhead utilities along Neighborhood Main Streets.
