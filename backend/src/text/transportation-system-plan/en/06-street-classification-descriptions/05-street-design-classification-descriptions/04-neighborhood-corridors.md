### Neighborhood Corridors

Neighborhood Corridors primarily serve surrounding neighborhoods and are designed to emphasize multimodal mobility between activity centers.

> **Land Use:** Neighborhood Corridors are primarily located along transit corridors and between segments of Neighborhood Main Streets, connecting the Central City, Regional Centers, Town Centers, and Neighborhood Centers. Development consists of a mix of uses that are oriented to the street.
>
> **Lanes:** Neighborhood Corridors typically include two vehicle lanes with additional turning lanes as needed.
>
> **Width:** Neighborhood Corridors generally feature a narrower right-of-way than Civic Corridors and may not be able to accommodate the full desired space for each mode.
>
> **Function:** Neighborhood Corridors emphasize mobility for all modes between activity centers while also accommodating access to adjacent land uses along the corridor.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Neighborhood Corridors should emphasize mobility functions such as bicycle facilities or turn lanes near intersections. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading if needed to support adjacent land use.
>
> **Separation:** Neighborhood Corridors have frequent street connections. Sidewalks should be provided and pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic, though shared roadway bicycle facilities may be acceptable if traffic volumes and speeds are sufficiently low.
>
> **Design Elements:** Neighborhood Corridor design should typically include the following: wide sidewalks with a through pedestrian zone, a furnishing zone, and a frontage zone; closely-spaced pedestrian crossings; separated bicycle facilities; way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes; low to moderate speeds; and medians and/or turn lanes as needed.
