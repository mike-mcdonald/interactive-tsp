### Local Service Transit Streets

Local Service Transit Streets primarily facilitate movement of smaller transit vehicles, including paratransit and community/jobs connector shuttles. Local Service Transit Streets seldom have regular transit service except for short street segments and do not typically include transit-specific street design elements such as bus stops. Local Service Transit Streets may be used for bus movements to and from a layover facility or bus garage, for turning around at the end of a line, or for temporary reroutes of a fixed-route line.

> **Land Use:** Transit operations on Local Service Transit Streets should give preference to access for individual properties and to the specific needs of property owners and residents along the street.
