### Transit Access Streets

Transit Access Streets facilitate movement of transit vehicles connecting town centers, neighborhood centers, and industrial and employment areas with other destinations and other transit service. Transit Access Streets are provided fixed-route service that is commensurate with the level of demand.

> **Land Use:** Encourage pedestrian- and transit-oriented development in commercial, institutional, and mixed-use areas along Transit Access Streets.
>
> **Access to Transit:** Provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access to transfer points and stops and along Transit Access Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Transit Access Streets.
>
> **Transfer Points:** Provide bus shelters, safe and convenient pedestrian crossings, and transit information at transfer points.
>
> **Improvements:** Provide transit signal priority as needed at major intersections and prioritize transit stops over on-street parking. Provide sufficient lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles where appropriate, taking into account other street classifications.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Transit Access Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for traffic slowing devices such as speed bumps or speed cushions. Traffic slowing devices should be designed in accordance with TriMet guidelines.
>
> **Bus Stops:** Stops should be located roughly every one-quarter mile, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, and transfer points. Stop spacing should also take into account existing sidewalk and street connectivity, with potentially closer stop spacing where sidewalk and street connectivity is more limited. On-street parking should be prohibited at bus stops in order to provide accessible waiting areas. Passenger amenities, including covered waiting areas, are appropriate along Transit Access Streets.
