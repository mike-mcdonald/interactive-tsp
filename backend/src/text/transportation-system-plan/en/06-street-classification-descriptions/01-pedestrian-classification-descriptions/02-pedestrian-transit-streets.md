### Pedestrian-Transit Streets

Pedestrian-Transit Streets are intended to create a strong and visible relationship between pedestrians and transit within the Central City.

> **Land Use:** Pedestrian-Transit Streets respond to significant public investments in public transportation, including light rail, the transit mall, and streetcar, and enhance the pedestrian environment adjacent to high-density land uses.
>
> **Improvements:** Improvements should include wide sidewalks to accommodate high levels of pedestrian traffic, urban design features that promote pedestrian activity, and visual signals to motor vehicles to recognize the priority of pedestrian and transit vehicles.
