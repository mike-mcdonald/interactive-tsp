## Pedestrian Classification Descriptions
*(adopted 2002, currently under review. See the update of the Pedestrian Master Plan at https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/72504)*

Pedestrian Classification Descriptions maintain a system of pedestrianways to serve all types of pedestrian trips, particularly those with a transportation function.
