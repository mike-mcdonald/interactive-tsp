## Urban Form Goals

(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 3)

### A city designed for people

Portland's built environment is designed to serve the needs and aspirations of all Portlanders, promoting prosperity, health, equity, and resiliency. New development, redevelopment, and public investments reduce disparities and encourage social interaction to create a healthy connected city. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.A)

### A climate and hazard resilient urban form

Portland's compact urban form, sustainable building development practices, green infrastructure, and active transportation system reduce carbon emissions, reduce natural hazard risks and impacts, and improve resilience to the effects of climate change. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.B)

### Focused growth

Household and employment growth is focused in the Central City and other centers, corridors, and transit station areas, creating compact urban development in areas with a high level of service and amenities, while allowing the relative stability of lower-density single-family residential areas. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.C)

### A system of centers and corridors

Portland's interconnected system of centers and corridors provides diverse housing options and employment opportunities, robust multimodal transportation connections, access to local services and amenities, and supports low-carbon complete, healthy, and equitable communities. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.D)

### Connected public realm and open spaces

A network of parks, streets, City Greenways, and other public spaces supports community interaction; connects neighborhoods, districts, and destinations; and improves air, water, land quality, and environmental health. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.E)
