### Regional Truckways

Regional Truckways are intended to facilitate interregional and movement of freight.

> **Land Use:** Support locating industrial and employment land uses with high levels of truck activity near Regional Truckway interchanges.
>
> **Function:** Provide for safe and efficient continuous-flow operation for trucks.
>
> **Connections:** Provide Regional Truckway interchanges that directly serve Freight Districts and connect to Priority Truck Streets and other streets with high levels of truck activity. A ramp that connects to a Regional Truck Street is classified as a Regional Truck Street up to its intersection with a lower-classified street.
>
> **Design:** Design Regional Truckways to be limited access facilities and to standards that facilitate the movement of all types of trucks.
