### Secondary Emergency Response Streets

Secondary Emergency Response Streets are intended to provide alternatives to Major Emergency Response Streets in cases when traffic congestion, construction, or other events occur that may cause undue delays in response times.

> **Improvements:** Design treatments on Secondary Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments, while also allowing for limited traffic slowing treatments to enhance safety and livability.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions. Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Secondary Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.
