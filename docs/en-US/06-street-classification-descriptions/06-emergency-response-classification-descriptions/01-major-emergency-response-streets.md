### Major Emergency Response Streets

Major Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the longer, most direct legs of emergency response trips.

> **Improvements:** Design treatments on Major Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Major Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.
