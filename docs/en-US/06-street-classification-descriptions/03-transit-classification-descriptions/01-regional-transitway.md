### Regional Transitways

Regional Transitways are intended to facilitate regional and interdistrict transit trips with fast and reliable service over long distances, operating in right-of-way exclusively reserved for transit use to the extent possible.

> **Land Use:** Development with a regional attraction (e.g., shopping centers, arenas) are encouraged to locate adjacent to Regional Transitway stations to reduce traffic impacts on adjoining areas and streets. Locate high-density development within a half-mile of transit stations on Regional Transitways, with the highest densities closest to the stations.
>
> **Access to Transit:** Transit stations should be designed to accommodate a high level of safe multimodal access within a half-mile radius of the station. Provide convenient connection opportunities at Regional Transitway stations when feasible, including feeder bus service, bike-share stations, secure bicycle parking, pick-up and drop-off zones, and shuttle services. Use park-and-ride facilities to access Regional Transit stations only at ends of Regional Transitways or where adequate feeder bus service is not feasible.
>
> **Improvements:** Use transit-preferential treatments to facilitate fast and reliable transit operations. Provide signal preemption or transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stations or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Provide exclusive or semi-exclusive transitways wherever possible, including treatments on freeways and expressways such as transit lanes, HOV lanes, HOT lanes, and "bus on shoulder" operations. Employ access management measures to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles. Right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures and improve access to transit. Carefully consider any street design changes to Regional Transitways that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.
>
> **Transit Stations:** Locate Regional Transitway stations at intervals of approximately one-half mile to two miles, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points, and people with disabilities. Express or limited service may have stations located further apart, as appropriate to serve origins and destinations. Transit stations should have a full range of passenger services, including accessible boarding platforms, covered waiting areas, route information, benches, secure bicycle parking, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.\
> \
> **Bus stops:** Buses providing local service along Regional Transitways should have more frequent stop spacing, similar to stop spacing along Major Transit Priority Streets.
>
> **Dual Classification:** A street with a dual Regional Transitway and Major Transit Priority Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major Transit Priority Street and respond to adjacent land uses.
>
> **Connections:** A ramp that connects to a Regional Transitway is classified as a Regional Transitway up to its intersection with a lower-classified street.
