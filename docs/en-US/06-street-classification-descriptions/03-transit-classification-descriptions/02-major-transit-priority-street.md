### Major Transit Priority Streets

Major Transit Priority Streets facilitate the frequent and reliable movement of transit vehicles that connect Central City, regional centers, and town centers with each other and to other major destinations. Major Transit Priority Streets are provided frequent service, or are expected to receive that level of service in the future to support envisioned growth.

> **Land Use:** Transit-oriented land uses should be encouraged to locate along Major Transit Priority Streets, especially in centers. Discourage auto-oriented develop­ment from locating on a Major Transit Priority Street, except where the street is outside the Central City, center, station community, or main street and is also classified as a Major City Traffic Street. Support land use densi­ties that vary directly with the existing and planned capacity of transit service.
>
> **Access to Transit:** Provide safe and convenient access for pedestrians and bicyclists to, across, and along Major Transit Priority Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Major Transit Priority Streets.
>
> **Improvements:** Provide transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stops or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Consider the use of exclusive or semi-exclusive transit lanes where needed to reduce congestion-related transit delay. Design intersections of Major Transit Priority Streets with other Major Transit Priority Streets or Transit Access Streets to allow turning movements of a standard transit vehicle. Where compatible with adjacent land use designations, right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures or improve access to transit. The use of access manage­ment should be considered where needed to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles.Carefully consider any street design changes to Major Transit Priority Streets that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Major Transit Priority Streets are not eligible for new traffic slowing devices such as speed bumps or speed cushions. Existing traffic slowing devices on Major Transit Priority Streets may remain and may be maintained and replaced as needed.
>
> **Transfer Points:** Provide safe and convenient transfer points with accessible stops, covered waiting areas, transit route information, benches, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.
>
> **Bus Stops:** Locate bus stops to provide convenient access to neighborhoods and commercial centers. Stops should be located roughly every one-quarter to one-half mile, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points and people with disabilities. Stop spacing should also take into account existing sidewalk and street connectivity, with potentially closer stop spacing where sidewalk and street connectivity is more limited. On-street parking should be prohibited at bus stops in order to provide accessible waiting areas. Passenger amenities should include shelters and route information.
