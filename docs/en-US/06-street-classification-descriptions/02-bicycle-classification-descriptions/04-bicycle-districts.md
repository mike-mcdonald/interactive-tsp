### Bicycle Districts

Bicycle Districts are areas with a dense concentration of commercial, cultural, institutional and/or recreational destinations where the City intends to make bicycle travel more attractive than driving.

> **Land Use:** High density and mixed-use neighborhoods should be targeted as bicycle districts. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Bicycle Districts.
>
> **Characteristics:** The size and configuration of a Bicycle District should be consistent with the scale of bicycling trips. A Bicycle District includes the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway.
>
> **Improvements:** All streets within a Bicycle District are important in serving bicycle trips. Appropriate bicycle facilities should be determined for each street based on the desired bicycling conditions and operations. Use the bikeway design and engineering guidelines to design streets within Bicycle Districts.
