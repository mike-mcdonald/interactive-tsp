### Local Service Bikeways

Local Service Bikeways are intended to serve local circulation needs for bicyclists and provide access to adjacent properties.

> **Classification:** All streets not classified as City Bikeways or Major City Bikeways with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Bikeways.
>
> **Improvements:** Consider the following design treatments for Local Service Bikeways: shared roadways, traffic calming, bicycle lanes, and extra-wide curb lanes. Crossings of Local Service Bikeways with other rights-of-way should minimize conflicts.
>
> **On-Street Parking:** On-street parking on Local Service Bikeways should not be removed to provide bicycle lanes.
>
> **Operation:** Treatment of Local Service Bikeways should not have a side effect of creating, accommodating, or encouraging automobile through-traffic.
