### Enhanced Greenway Corridors

Enhanced Greenway Corridors are designed to provide a network of scenic low-stress connections that prioritize walking and/or bicycling and often include natural features as well as innovative urban design and place-making elements.

> **Dual Classification:** Streets may have an Enhanced Greenway Corridor classification in addition to another street design classification. When developing or retrofitting these streets, incorporate Enhanced Greenway Corridor design elements within the corridor.
>
> **Land Use:** Enhanced Greenway Corridors connect parks, open spaces, and singular attractions throughout the City to each other and to surrounding neighborhoods via a network of scenic and low-stress walking and/or bicycling routes. They can run through a variety of different land use contexts, including residential neighborhoods, natural areas, industrial areas, and employment centers.
>
> **Design Elements:** Enhanced Greenway Corridor design can take many forms, and should use flexible design treatments appropriate to adjacent land use context. Design elements may include: neighborhood greenways; traffic calming; motor vehicle diversion; multi-use paths; wide sidewalks; boardwalks; trails; separated bikeways; broad-canopy trees and landscaping; scenic views; stormwater management; underground utilities; special lighting; and way-finding. Where appropriate, pedestrian and bicycle routes may use separate parallel routes or streets along a corridor.
