### Civic Main Streets

Civic Main Streets serve people throughout the City and are designed to emphasize multimodal access to major activity centers.

> **Land Use:** Civic Main Streets are segments of Civic Corridors located within the Central City, Regional Centers, Town Centers, Neighborhood Centers, and other areas of intensive commercial activity. Development consists of a mix of uses that are oriented to the street.

> **Lanes:** Civic Main Streets typically include two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed. Lanes may be dedicated as transit-only or business-access-transit lanes if needed to improve transit speed and reliability.

> **Width:** Civic Main Streets generally feature a wider right-of-way than Neighborhood Main Streets and are more often able to provide the desired space for each mode and function.
>
> **Function:** Civic Main Streets should emphasize pedestrian access to adjacent land uses while also accommodating access and mobility for other modes.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Civic Main Streets should emphasize access and place-making functions (such as parking, loading, transit stops, street trees, curb extensions, and street seats) to support adjacent land use and improve the pedestrian realm. The curb zone may be used for mobility functions if space is needed to provide bicycle facilities or provide turn lanes near intersections.
>
> **Separation:** Civic Main Streets have frequent street connections and support multimodal access to destinations. Sidewalks should be provided, and pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Design Elements:** Civic Main Street design should typically include the following: wide sidewalks with a through pedestrian zone, a furnishing zone, and a frontage zone; closely-spaced pedestrian crossings; separated bicycle facilities; way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes; low vehicle speeds; medians and/or turn lanes as needed; and limited driveway access.
>
> **Design Treatment:** During improvement projects, the preservation of existing vegetation, topography, vistas and viewpoints, driver perception, street lighting, and sight distance requirements should be considered.
>
> **Utilities:** Consider undergrounding or reducing the visual impact of overhead utilities along Civic Main Streets.
