## Street Design Classification Descriptions

Street Design Classification Descriptions provide general design guidance based on the current and planned land use context around the street. Whenever possible, a "complete streets" approach should be taken during street design to accommodate all necessary modes and functions, taking into account the modal classifications. Where right-of-way is limited and tradeoffs must be made, refer to the modal street classifications as well as the Transportation Strategy for People Movement (Policy 9.6) to help guide decision-making regarding allocation of right-of-way. If one or more modes are still unable to be accommodated in the available right-of-way, a "complete networks" approach should be used to ensure that those modes are still accommodated on parallel routes as a part of project design.
