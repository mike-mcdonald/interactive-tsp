### Local Streets

Local Streets are designed to complement planned land uses and reduce dependence on arterials for local circulation.

> **Land Use:** Local Streets are multimodal, but are not intended for trucks (other than local deliveries) in residential areas. Local Streets are important for local circulation of trucks in commercial and industrial areas.
>
> **Design:** Local Street design typically includes frequent street connections, sidewalks, on-street parking, stormwater facilities, and planting of street trees and ground covers (where planting strips are included). A shared street design without sidewalks may be appropriate where traffic volumes are sufficiently low.
>
> **Classification:** All streets not classified as Urban Throughways, Urban Highways, Industrial Roads, Civic Main Streets, Neighborhood Main Streets, Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Corridors, Regional Corridors, or Community Corridors are classified as Local Streets for street design.
