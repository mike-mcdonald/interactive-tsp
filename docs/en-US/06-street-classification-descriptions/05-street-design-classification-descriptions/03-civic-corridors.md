### Civic Corridors

Civic Corridors serve people throughout the City and are designed to emphasize multimodal mobility between major activity centers.

> **Land Use:** Civic Corridors are located primarily along major transit corridors and between Civic Main Street segments, connecting the Central City, Regional Centers, Town Centers, and Neighborhood Centers. Development consists of a mix of uses that are oriented to the street.
>
> **Lanes:** Civic Corridors typically include two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed. Lanes may be dedicated as transit-only or business-access-transit lanes if needed to improve transit speed and reliability.
>
> **Width:** Civic Corridors generally feature a wider right-of-way than Neighborhood Corridors and are more often able to provide the desired space for each mode and function.
>
> **Function:** Civic Corridors emphasize mobility for all modes between major activity centers while also accommodating access to adjacent land uses along the corridor.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Civic Corridors should typically emphasize mobility functions such as bicycle facilities or turn lanes near intersections. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading if needed to support adjacent land use.
>
> **Separation:** Civic Corridors have frequent street connections. Sidewalks should be provided and pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Design Elements:** Civic Corridor design should typically include the following: wide sidewalks with a through pedestrian zone, a furnishing zone, and a frontage zone; closely-spaced pedestrian crossings; separated bicycle facilities; way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes; low to moderate speeds; and medians and/or turn lanes as needed.
