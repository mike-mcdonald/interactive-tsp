### Industrial Roads

Industrial Roads are designed to emphasize freight mobility while also accommodating other modes and providing local access.

> **Land Use:** Industrial Roads typically serve industrial areas and freight intermodal sites, with a significant percentage of trips being made by trucks. Adjacent land uses sometimes orient to the Industrial Road.
>
> **Lanes:** Industrial Road design typically includes two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed. Dedicated freight-only lanes or turn pockets may be provided as needed to support roadway efficiency.
>
> **Function:** Industrial Roads emphasize freight mobility while accommodating other modes and providing access to industrial sites and freight districts.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Industrial Roads primarily serves mobility functions such as vehicle lanes or bike lanes. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading at limited locations if needed to support adjacent land use.
>
> **Separation:** Industrial Roads have limited street connections that may occur at the same grade or separate grades. Pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Design Elements:** Industrial Road design typically includes vehicle lanes, medians or center turn lanes where needed, limited driveway access, pullouts for bus stops, transit priority treatments, separated pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and improved pedestrian crossings located on overpasses, underpasses, or signalized at-grade intersections. Industrial Roads may also include design treatments that improve freight mobility, such as freight-only lanes, freight signal priority, and a wider turning radius at intersections.
