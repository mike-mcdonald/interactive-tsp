### Urban Throughways

Urban Throughways are designed to emphasize long-distance mobility for motor vehicle, freight, and transit trips throughout the region.

> **Land Use:** Urban Throughways connect major activity centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Adjacent land uses sometimes orient directly to Urban Throughways.
>
> **Lanes:** Urban Throughways usually have four to six vehicle lanes, with additional lanes in some situations. Dedicated high-occupancy-vehicle, freight-only, or transit-only lanes may be provided to support more efficient use of Urban Throughways.
>
> **Function:** Urban Throughways primarily serve a mobility function, with little or no local access provided along the street.
>
> **Separation:** Urban Throughways may be completely divided, with no left turns, or they may be mostly divided, with limited opportunities for left turns. Street connections may occur at separated grades, with access controlled by ramps, or there may be limited street connections at grade. If designed as a grade-separated freeway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be provided on overpasses or underpasses, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities along the corridor should be provided on parallel pathways. If designed as a limited-access highway or expressway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be either grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Design Elements:** Urban Throughway design typically includes vehicle lanes, grade-separated or signalized pedestrian and bicycle, parallel pathways or separated facilities for pedestrian and bicycle travel, clear sightlines, median barriers, shoulders, and motor vehicle lane widths that accommodate freight movement. Where appropriate, transit priority treatments should be used to enhance transit speed and reliability. Encourage the Oregon Department of Transportation to maintain a continuous landscape along Urban Throughways that reduces the visual impacts of the throughway on motorists and adjacent land uses.
>
> **Connections:** A ramp that connects to an Urban Throughway is classified as an Urban Throughway up to its intersection with a differently-classified street. An interchange between an Urban Throughway and a differently-classified street should be designed to safely accommodate all modes and provide the least possible disruption to the surrounding modal networks. Connections should be provided across Urban Throughways at closely-spaced intervals to provide greater street connectivity.
