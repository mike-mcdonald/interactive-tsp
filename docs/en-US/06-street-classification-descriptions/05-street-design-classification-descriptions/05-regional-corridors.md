### Regional Corridors

Regional Corridors serve people throughout the City and are designed to emphasize multimodal mobility between cities in the region.

> **Land Use:** Regional Corridors connect Regional, Town, and Neighborhood Centers to other cities in the region.
>
> **Lanes:** Regional Corridors usually include two to four vehicle lanes. They occasionally have additional lanes in some situations, such as to allow turning movements. Lanes may be dedicated as transit-only or business-access-transit lanes if needed to improve transit speed and reliability.
>
> **Width:** Regional Corridors generally feature a wider right-of-way than Community Corridors and are more often able to provide the full desired space for each mode.
>
> **Function:** Regional Corridors emphasize mobility for all modes between cities while also accommodating access to adjacent land uses along the corridor.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Regional Corridors should emphasize mobility functions such as bicycle facilities or turn lanes near intersections. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading if needed to support adjacent land use.
>
> **Separation:** Regional Corridors can have moderately spaced street connections. Sidewalks should be provided and pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Design Elements:** Regional Corridor design should typically include the following: sidewalks; pedestrian crossings where needed to serve transit stops or destinations; separated bicycle facilities; way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes; and medians and/or turn lanes as needed.
