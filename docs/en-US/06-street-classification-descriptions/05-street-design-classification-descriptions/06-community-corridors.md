### Community Corridors

Community Corridors primarily serve surrounding neighborhoods and are designed to emphasize multimodal mobility between neighborhoods.

> **Land Use:** Community Corridors connect Regional, Town, and Neighborhood Centers to surrounding neighborhoods.
>
> **Lanes:** Lanes may be dedicated as transit-only or business-access-transit lanes if needed to improve transit speed and reliability.
>
> **Width:** Community Corridors generally feature a narrower right-of-way than Regional Corridors and may not be able to accommodate the full desired space for each mode.
>
> **Function:** Community Corridors emphasize mobility for all modes between neighborhoods while also accommodating access to adjacent land uses along the corridor.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Community Corridors should emphasize mobility functions such as bicycle facilities or turn lanes near intersections. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading if needed to support adjacent land use.
>
> **Separation:** Community Corridors have closely spaced street connections. Sidewalks should be provided and pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic, though shared roadway bicycle facilities may be acceptable if traffic volumes and speeds are sufficiently low.
>
> **Design Elements:** Community Corridor design should typically include the following: sidewalks; pedestrian crossings where needed to serve transit stops or destinations; separated bicycle facilities; way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes; and medians and/or turn lanes as needed.
