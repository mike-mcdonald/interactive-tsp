### District Collectors

District Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets to streets of the same or lower classification or to serve trips that both start and end within a district.

> **Safety:** Safety should be the highest priority on District Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be employed to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** District Collectors generally connect town centers, corridors, main streets, and neighborhoods to nearby regional centers and other major destinations. Land uses that attract trips from the surrounding neighborÂ­hoods or from throughout the district should be encouraged to locate on District Collectors. Regional attractors of traffic such as major shopping centers or arenas should be discouraged from locating on District Collectors.
>
> **Connections:** District Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, other collectors, and local streets and, where necessary, to Regional Trafficways. Where a District Collector intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.
>
> **Right-of-way acquisition:** Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on District Collectors, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.
