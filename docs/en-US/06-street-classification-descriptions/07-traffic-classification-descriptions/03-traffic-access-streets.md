### Traffic Access Streets

Traffic Access Streets are intended to provide access to Central City destinations, distribute traffic within a Central City sub-district, provide connections between Central City subdistricts, and distribute traffic from Regional Trafficways and Major City Traffic Streets for access within the district. Traffic Access Streets are not intended for through-traffic with no trip ends in the district.

> **Safety:** Safety should be the highest priority on Traffic Access Streets. Traffic Access Streets should provide frequent, safe crossings for people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** Traffic Access Streets serve Central City land uses. Traffic management on Traffic Access Streets must accommodate the high-density pattern desired in the Central City.
>
> **Connections:** Connections to adjoining transportation districts should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of Traffic Access Streets and other streets with higher or similar classifications should be signalized, where warranted, to facilitate the safe movement of traffic along each street as well as turning movements from one street to the other.
>
> **Access:** Reduction in motor vehicle congestion is given less priority than: supporting pedestrian access and enhancing the pedestrian environment; maintaining on-street parking to support land uses; accommodating transit; or accommodating bicycles. Access to off-street parking is allowed and encouraged to be located on Traffic Access Streets.
>
> **Right-of-way acquisition:** Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Traffic Access Streets, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.
