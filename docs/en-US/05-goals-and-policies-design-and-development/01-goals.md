## Design and Development Goals

(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 4)

### Context-sensitive Design and Development

New development is designed to respond to and enhance the distinctive physical, historic, and cultural qualities of its location, while accommodating growth and change. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 4.A)

### Human and Environmental Health

Neighborhoods and development are efficiently designed and built to enhance human and environmental health: they protect safety and livability; support local access to healthy food; limit negative impacts on water, hydrology, and air quality; reduce carbon emissions; encourage active and sustainable design; protect wildlife; address urban heat islands; and integrate nature and the built environment. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 4.C)
